The **joint state** of a **system of Qubits** is described using an operation known as **Tensor Product** ![Operator](assets/tensor-product-symbol.png). Say, we've three ~~individually~~ **independent states**... ![State of a Qubit is 2D complex vector](assets/three-single-qubit-states-2d-complex-vector.png) where ![2D complex vector is the sum of two basis states](assets/2-dimensional-complex-vector-is-sum-of-two-basis-vectors.png) then, the **full state** of a **system** **composed** of **three independent** **Qubits** can be described as... ![Full state of a system composed of three independent qubits](assets/full-state-of-a-system-composed-of-three-independent-qubits.png)  
![2^nD complex vector](assets/2%5E3-dimensional-complex-vector.png) 
Expresses the fact that **joint state** of **n Quibits** is the **2^n**D complex vector. 
A measurment of this system would collapse the joint state into any of the **2^3** possible **bit-strings** ![bit-strings](assets/2%5E3-possible-bit-strings.png)
