A qubit is a fundamental quantum particle. All fundamental quantum particles have a property known as spin. A quantum computer instead of using transistors uses spins and put all spins in a joint state known as super position of spins, super position of spins is the set of all combinations of these spins. Each combination is a different state of the memory. The more spins you have the more combinations you have and thus more combinations means more memory.   

Mathematically we now have a one wave function which describes every thing about all the qubits in the joint state of spins and this is called entanglement.  In entanglement the qubits are inexplicably linked, measurement of one of the qubit is now correlated with the measurement of the other qubits in a function of joint states as well. 

### The state of a qubit cannot be measured without changing it...

After you have made a measurement, the probability of what you measured suddenly changes to one.  After measurement you've to update the wave function so that the probability of that part of the wave function which describes the measurement becomes 100%.
 
The **Schrödinger equation** is linear, that means if you've two different states of a system and both of which are allowed according to the **Schrödinger equation** then the sum of the two states is also an allowed state.

The problem with quantum measurement now is that update of wave function is incompatible with **Schrödinger equation**. Before the measurement you had two allowed states and after the measurement update, you've two states and out these two states there's one state part of which has a probability of 1. This is the reason we hear the phrase that "before measurement a qubit changes according to **Schrödinger equation** equation".
 
Hence, unlike classical bit **the state of a qubit cannot be measured without changing it**. 

### Entanglement.

In quantum computing you can modify the  the probabilities of the values being read(measured). Lets go...

&phi;**&#7522;** = 1/&#8730;2(**|0&rang; + |1&rang;**) &#8704; i = 1, 2, 3

**&phi;**&#8321;&#8855;**&phi;**&#8322;&#8855;**&phi;**&#8323; = 1/2&sup3;<sup>&sol;</sup>&sup2; (|000&rang;  + |001&rang;  + |010&rang;  + |011&rang; + |100&rang; + |101&rang;  + |110&rang;  + |111&rang;)

let Ψ = &phi;&#8321;&#8855;&phi;&#8322;&#8855;&phi;&#8323;

- Our measurement results in all those states with bit string which have 0 at the beginning... |Ψ&#8321;&rang; = 1/2(|000&rang; + |001&rang; + |010&rang; + |011&rang;)

- Now our measurements resulted in all those states having bit string  which have 0 in the middle...  |Ψ&#8322;&rang; = 1/&#8730;2(|000&rang; + |001&rang;)

- Finally we arrive at the last state and our measurement resulted in state which has 1 at the end of state bit string... |Ψ&#8323;&rang; = |001&rang;
