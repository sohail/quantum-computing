The **joint state** of a **system of Qubits** is described using an operation known as **Tensor Product** ![Operator](assets/tensor-product-symbol.png). Say, we've three ~~individually~~ **independent states**... ![State of a Qubit is 2D complex vector](assets/three-single-qubit-states-2d-complex-vector.png) then, the **full state** of a **system** **composed** of **three independent** **Qubits** can be described as... ![Full state of a system composed of three independent qubits](https://github.com/sohail/quantum-computing/blob/master/assets/full-state-of-a-system-composed-of-three-independent-qubits.png)
