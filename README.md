Trying to get my head around the field of Quantum Computing, this repository contains my study notes

* [State of Qubit in Blochsphere](https://github.com/sohail/quantum-computing/blob/master/blochsphere.md)
* [Interference](https://github.com/sohail/quantum-computing/blob/master/interference.md)
* [Planck's Constant](https://github.com/sohail/quantum-computing/blob/master/plancksconstant.md)
