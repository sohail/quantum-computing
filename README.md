# Quantum Computing

|Trying to get my head around the field of Quantum Computing, this repository contains my study notes|

**Quantum Physics** is the study of **Quantum Theory**. **Quantum Mechanics** is the **Mathematical Language** used to describe **Quantum Theory**.

**Schrödinger Equation** applies to **Quantum Systems**. The **Schrödinger Equation** describes the **Wave Function** or **State Function** of a **Quantum Mechanical System**.

**Quantum Systems** are made up of such **sub-atomic** particles which have only one specific **discrete level of energy**. They can only exist at one specific **quantized energy level** and no where else __OR__, these are such systems which exits as a **wave** as long as they do not get measured as the act of __measurement collapses the wave function__(~~act of measurement turns the wave in the ocean into a beach stone~~).

The **Qubit** is the quantum mechanical generalization of a bit used in classical computers. More precisely a **Qubit** is a two dimensional quantum system. As long as you do not measure it, it changes according to **Schrödinger Equation**.

In **ket notation** the state of **Qubit** can be described as such... **|Ψ⟩ = &prop;|0&rang; + &Beta;|1&rang;**. Which means that a **Qubit** in state **PSI**(**Ψ**) is in a **super position of states**(when one thing is really two or more things at once). **&prop;|0&rang;** and **&Beta;|1&rang;** represent the two basis states such that, when **Qubit** gets measured the **Qubit collapses into one of the two basis states**.

## Wave particle duality

All matter has *wavelength*(De Broglie wavelength) from tiny particle such as **electron** is, to us humans and to a star such as our sun is. This wavelength is the reason that quantum systems such as photon, electron etc have discrete(**energy levels assigned in a whole bunches or nothing at all**) and not continuous level of energy. Mass and wavelength are inversely related. The **mass of an electron is 9.10938356 × 10-31 kilograms**, it is so small that its wavelength(at any discrete level) is indeed relevant and this makes us **view electron** and any thing else not bigger than a molecule **as wave and as particle** at the same time. 

__De Broglie wavelength__

&lambda; = **h**/**P**
where **h** = 6.626176x10^-34 joule-seconds
**P** is momentum and momentum is mass(**m**) x velocity(**v**)
