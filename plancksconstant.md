### Planck's Constant

**Photons** are not thought to be made up of smaller particles. They are a basic unit of nature and are an elementary particle. A photons energy is equal to its frequency multiplied by Planck's constant. The Planck's constant is symbolized by **h** and approximately **h**=**6.626176x10^-34** joule-seconds.

**E** = **h**x**f**

* **f** is frequency is in Hz, 
* **E**  is energy per photon and 
* **h** is the Planck's Constant
